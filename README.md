# kurdish-wordle
Sorani Kurdish version of the word-guessing game Wordle.

All code in this repository has been adapted from [this](https://github.com/hannahcode/word-guessing-game) open-source Wordle clone.

The wordlist includes all 5-letter words in the Sorani Kurdish Wikipedia, and I hand-picked the list of possible answers to ensure that they are all commonly used. If you want to augment this, you can either add to the list of possible answers (manually or otherwise) or enable users to input characters directly using a Kurdish keyboard layout (instead of clicking on letters).
